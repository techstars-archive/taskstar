# Taskstar

Taskstar is an app developed and used internally at Techstars Seattle 2013.

Its purpose is to allow the Techstars teams to add new tasks to a queue, that the Hackstars can then use to find out what they can help with.

For a team to add a new task they can click on the "add task" link at the top of the main page. Then fill out the form and submit. The task is then available in the "Task" queue.

Hackstars can login into the app and see the current task that the teams need help with. By clicking on a task from the queue they can see more details about the task. They can then choose to start work on the task.

If the Hackstar chooses to work on a task they click the "Work On This" button, the task is then removed from the task queue and added to the "In Progress" queue.

After the task has been completed the Hackstar returns to the task description page and marks the task as "Done", which moves the task to the "Finished Tasks" queue.
